==============

don't you love getting cat facts?

## about ##
This is a mirror of my old repo for cat facts, I wrote this when I was just learning ruby a few years ago. Time flies when you're writing code! Maybe someday I'll rewrite this with the Twilio API.

## how2use ##
1. Have google voice
2. Fill in account information in the top of the file
3. ruby catfacts.rb
4. type in the phone number that you want to catfact
5. laugh maniacally as your friend suffers through facts about cats

## disclaimer ##
I honestly have no idea how well this works, I haven't run the script in forever and google voice has changed quite a bit. Also the code is horrible. Try not to let it burn your eyes.
